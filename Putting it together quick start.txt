Putting it together: quick start

Install Linux server (I used Ubuntu 18.0.4 LTS)

Use a static IP address for the server (and optional second interface for listening UDP)

Install a mail tool such as mailutils/sendmail/mutt

Create the syslog root folder /syslogs in your preferred location. I used a separate hard drive entirely for this but this is optional. It can be a folder with the / drive, or on another disk partition. 

Install syslog-ng (I used 3.13)

Rename the file /etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf to /etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf.old

Place the provided syslog-ng.conf in the above directory; restart syslog-ng service or reboot. Note: change the IP address and ports within the config to suit. 

Install Apache Web server (optional, for the web-based log access using indexing)

Place the provided apache config file 000-default in the /etc/apache2/sites-available/ folder. If you have no other web sites on the server then you can replace the default. Restart apache2 service or reboot. 

Create your folder structure ( see ‘ReadMe Folder Structure.txt’)

Place the syslog_commander.sh and syslog_logrotate.sh in the /root/ folder

Place the rule files, plus any you create, in the /root/syslog_rules folder

Edit the rule files to target your device log folders

Place Cisco (not tested with other hardware) config files in the /root/configs folder.

Edit root crontab ( while root run 'crontab -e') and add the lines from the file ‘crontab’ (recommend copy and paste)

Edit syslog_logrotate.sh to suite your retention days for archiving content.
