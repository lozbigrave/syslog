# syslog
Complete central syslog solution using Linux and syslog-ng

At the heart: Ubuntu Linux Server running syslog-ng (https://www.syslog-ng.com/products/open-source-log-management/)

This is a bespoke and GPL syslog solution to receive logs from remote devices and store them in a central repository. There is also log-archiving and event email alerting included. 

The structure:

Logs are stored in a root folder named /syslogs

The sub folders are the IP address of the sending device and the date thus:

/syslogs/10.1.1.1/2018/08/01/2018.08.01 for device 10.1.1.1, for logs sent on the 1st of August 2018. In this example 2018.08.01 is the daily log file. 

/syslogs/172.16.1.1/2017/07/10/2017.07.10 for device 172.16.1.1, for logs sent on the 10th of July 2017. In this example 2017.07.10 is the daily log file. 

This structure is automatically generated by the stalwart application syslog-ng.
