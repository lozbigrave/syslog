# syslog
Welcome to my syslog project, a free, centralised syslog solution using Linux and syslog-ng

This is a bespoke and GPL syslog solution to receive logs from remote devices and store them in a central repository. 

Features:
•	A centralised syslog server running Linux
•	Syslogs from remote devices stored in folders per-device and sub organised by date
•	Email alerting for events
•	Listening sockets on UDP/TCP and multiple ports
•	Web interface for log browsing
•	Archiving (to tar.gz) for aging logs

At the heart: Ubuntu Linux Server running syslog-ng (https://www.syslog-ng.com/products/open-source-log-management/)

The log structure:

Logs are stored in a folder named /syslogs

The sub folders are the IP address of the sending device and subfolders based on the date, thus:

/syslogs/10.1.1.1/2018/08/01/2018.08.01 for device 10.1.1.1, for logs sent on the 1st of August 2018. In this example 2018.08.01 is the daily log file. 

/syslogs/172.16.1.1/2017/07/10/2017.07.10 for device 172.16.1.1, for logs sent on the 10th of July 2017. In this example 2017.07.10 is the daily log file. 

This folder structure is automatically generated by the stalwart application syslog-ng. If you are only interested in using a syslog server with date-formatted folder structures then you can use the pre-configured syslog-ng.conf configuration file and skip the rest.
